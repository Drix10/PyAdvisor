"""
Setup GitHub Repository:

Create a new GitHub repository for your PyAdvisor project.
Initialize the repository with a README and any necessary files.

GitHub API Integration:

Research the GitHub API and understand how to make requests to fetch user data.
Decide which specific data you want to retrieve from users' GitHub profiles (e.g., repositories, languages used, contributions).
Write code to integrate with the GitHub API and fetch the desired data.
Test the API integration to ensure that you can successfully retrieve user data.

Command-Line Interface (CLI):

Choose a Python library for building command-line interfaces (e.g., argparse, click).
Design the CLI prompts to ask users for their GitHub username or profile URL.
Optionally, design additional prompts to ask users for extra information about their skills, interests, and goals.
Write code to parse user input from the command line and handle different scenarios (e.g., invalid input).
Test the CLI interface to ensure that it works as expected and accurately collects user input.

Data Processing and Recommendation Generation:

Write code to process the retrieved GitHub data and any additional user input.
Design algorithms or heuristics to generate personalized recommendations based on the collected data.
Test the recommendation generation logic to ensure that it produces relevant and useful recommendations for users.
Output Recommendations:

Write code to format and display the generated recommendations in the command-line interface.
Provide links to relevant GitHub repositories, resources, or articles for further exploration.
Test the recommendation output to ensure that it is clear, concise, and informative.

Error Handling and Validation:

Implement error handling and validation throughout the code to handle unexpected situations gracefully.
Provide informative error messages to guide users in case of input errors or API failures.
Test the error handling and validation to ensure that the application behaves as expected under different scenarios.

Documentation and Testing:

Document the usage of PyAdvisor in the README file, including instructions for installation and usage.
Write unit tests to verify the correctness of individual components and functions.
Test the entire application end-to-end to ensure that all features work together seamlessly.

Deployment (Optional):

Decide whether you want to deploy PyAdvisor as a standalone application or keep it as a local project.
If deploying, consider packaging the application into a distributable format (e.g., executable, Docker container) for easy distribution and installation.
By following these steps, you can systematically develop and complete PyAdvisor, ensuring that it meets the requirements discussed earlier and provides a valuable and user-friendly experience for users.
